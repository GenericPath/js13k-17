# js13k-17
Game made for js13k 2017

This was my first time using Javascript and obviously creating a JS & HTML5 game.

Things that could've been added provided more time (started halfway through competition)
- Music
- Change spawning of enemies so that it is better
- Add an intro screen to the game instead of text in HTML5

Overall pretty happy with it.
